✨ Features
Fully playable Minesweeper grid

Adjustable difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard

Timer that tracks how long you’ve played

Restart/Reset button

Color-coded tile reveals

Sound placeholders for different game events

Clean and intuitive Tkinter GUI

🧠 How It Works
The program creates a size x size grid of buttons, where:

A certain number of bombs are hidden randomly

Clicking on a cell reveals:

A number (if there are bombs nearby)

A blank space (if no bombs are nearby, recursively reveals neighbors)

A bomb (game over)

The game ends when:

All non-bomb cells are revealed (you win)

You click on a bomb (you lose)

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x

Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

playsound or pygame module for sound (Optional – Not implemented yet, sound is mocked using print())


cd minesweeper-tkinter
(Optional) Install dependencies for sound (if you want real sounds):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pygame
▶️ How to Run
Just run the Python file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python minesweeper.py
It will open a Tkinter window with a playable Minesweeper board.

🎮 Game Rules
Click on a cell to reveal it.

A number indicates how many bombs are adjacent to that cell.

Click on a bomb? Game over!

Clear all non-bomb cells to win.

You can switch difficulty using the dropdown.

Click the 🔄 Reset Game button anytime to start fresh.

🗂 File Structure
text
Copy
Edit
minesweeper.py       # Main game logic
README.md            # Game instructions and explanation
start_sound.mp3      # (Optional) Sound files placeholder
click_sound.mp3
bomb_sound.mp3
win_sound.mp3
lose_sound.mp3
Note: Sound files are referenced but not implemented; they're printed as a placeholder (e.g., "Playing sound: win_sound.mp3").

🛠️ Customization
Want to change the game?

Grid Size & Bombs: Change default in __init__():

python
Copy
Edit
game = Minesweeper(size=5, bombs=3)
Colors & Fonts: Tweak button and label styles.

Real Sounds: Replace play_sound()'s print() with actual sound-playing logic using pygame.mixer or playsound.

📌 Difficulty Levels

Level	Grid Size	Bomb Count
Easy	5x5	5
Medium	8x8	12
Hard	10x10	20
You can switch difficulty anytime using the dropdown.
