# 🤖 Guess the Number - Python Game

Welcome to **"Guess the Number"**, a fun terminal-based guessing game where the computer tries to guess the number you're thinking of! 🧠🎯

---

## 📜 How It Works

- You choose a maximum number (e.g., 100).
- Think of any number between 1 and that maximum.
- The computer will guess, and you respond with:
  - **H** if the guess is **too high**
  - **L** if the guess is **too low**
  - **C** if the guess is **correct**
- The game continues until the computer guesses correctly.

## 🖥️ Features

- Interactive terminal input
- Input validation
- Randomized computer guesses
- Fun response messages when the computer wins
- Option to play again
- Green colored terminal text for a cool aesthetic 🌿

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (`python3` or `python`)
2. Copy the code into a file, for example: `guess_the_number.py`
3. Run the game using:

```bash
python guess_the_number.py
🎮 Example
java
Copy
Edit
Enter the maximum number I should guess up to: 50
Is 25 too high (H), too low (L), or correct (C)? L
Is 38 too high (H), too low (L), or correct (C)? H
Is 31 too high (H), too low (L), or correct (C)? C
🎉 Yay! I guessed your number, 31, correctly in 3 attempts! That was easy! 😎
Do you want to play again? (yes/no): no
Thanks for playing! 🎮
🧪 Requirements
Python 3.x

Works best in terminal/command prompt that supports ANSI escape codes for colored output
