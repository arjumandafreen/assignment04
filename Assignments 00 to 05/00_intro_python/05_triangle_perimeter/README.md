# 🔺 Triangle Perimeter Calculator

This is a beautiful and interactive **Triangle Perimeter Calculator** built with Python. The program takes the lengths of all three sides of a triangle from the user and calculates the perimeter. It's designed to be user-friendly, colorful, and fun to use in the terminal!



## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to:
- Practice input validation using `try-except`
- Enhance user experience with colorful terminal output
- Demonstrate how to use third-party Python libraries for styling terminal applications

## 📌 Features

✅ Stylish ASCII banner using `pyfiglet`  
✅ Color-coded prompts, errors, and results with `termcolor`  
✅ Input validation to ensure numbers are entered correctly  
✅ Clean and modular structure for easy understanding
