Chaotic Counting Script 🎲
This Python script performs a fun and unpredictable count from 1 to 10. It features a random stop condition that can interrupt the count at any point. For better terminal output, it uses the termcolor library to apply colors to the text. 🌈

How It Works 🔁
The script begins by displaying a message that it might count up to 10 — unless it decides to quit early. 🚦

It starts printing numbers from 1 through 10, with each one shown in green. ✅

At any point during the count, a built-in probability (DONE_LIKELIHOOD) may trigger an early stop. 🎰

Whether it reaches the end or stops mid-way, the program concludes by printing a "done" message in blue. 🧊

Requirements 📋
termcolor: Used to add color to terminal text output. 🖍️

random: A built-in Python module for generating random values. 🎯
