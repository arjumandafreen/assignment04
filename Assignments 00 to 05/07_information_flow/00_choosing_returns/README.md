# Is Adult Checker

This Python script checks whether a person is legally an adult based on their age.  
In this example, the adult age is set to **18** (U.S. standard).

## 🧠 Features

- Accepts user input for age
- Validates the input
- Returns `True` if the age is 18 or older, otherwise `False`
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `is_adult.py` (or any name you prefer).
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python is_adult.py
Enter the age when prompted.

How old is this person?: 20
