# 🔺 Hypotenuse Calculator

A **colorful and interactive Python tool** to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem! 🎯

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Calculates the hypotenuse based on user input for AB and AC
- 🌈 Beautiful and colorful terminal output using `colorama`
- 📏 Easy and fun to use for students, teachers, or geometry lovers!
- 🚫 Handles invalid inputs with friendly error messages

---

## 📐 Formula Used

We use the **Pythagorean Theorem**:
BC² = AB² + AC²



So,

BC = √(AB² + AC²)



---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository


cd hypotenuse-calculator
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Install the required library:


pip install colorama
3. Run the Script

python hypotenuse_calculator.py
💡 Sample Output

🔺 Welcome to the Hypotenuse Calculator! 🔺

📏 Enter the length of side AB: 3
📐 Enter the length of side AC: 4

✅ The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.00
✨ Calculation Complete! ✨
