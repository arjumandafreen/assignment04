# ⚡ Einstein's Energy Calculator — `E = mc²`

A simple and beautiful Python program that calculates energy using Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence formula: `E = m × c²`.

---

## 📚 Purpose of the Code

This Python script allows users to input a mass value in **kilograms**, and it calculates the corresponding **energy** in **joules** using the speed of light constant (`c = 299,792,458 m/s`). The program demonstrates the practical application of the formula `E = mc²`, showing how even a small amount of mass can convert to a massive amount of energy.

## 📐 Formula Explained

The formula used is:

E = m × c²

Where:

- `E` = energy in **joules (J)**
- `m` = mass in **kilograms (kg)**
- `c` = speed of light in a vacuum = `299,792,458 m/s`

### 🧠 What it means:
Einstein's equation tells us that **mass and energy are interchangeable**. Even a tiny amount of mass can become a huge amount of energy, which is the basis behind nuclear reactions and explains a lot about how our universe works.
