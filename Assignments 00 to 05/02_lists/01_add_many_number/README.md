# 🔢 Sum of Numbers Program

This Python script demonstrates a simple yet elegant program that calculates the sum of a list of integers using a custom function.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts a list of integers
- Calculates and displays the total sum
- Includes stylish and user-friendly terminal output
- Clean and modular code structure
- Easy to understand and modify

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A list of numbers is defined.
2. The `add_many_numbers()` function takes this list and returns the total sum.
3. The `main()` function handles the execution and prints the result in a formatted way.
