# Double Numbers

This is a simple Python script that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with each number doubled. It's a basic example demonstrating the use of list comprehensions and functions in Python.

## 📁 File Structure

double_numbers.py README.md



## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.9+ recommended).
2. Run the script using the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python double_numbers.py
🧠 How It Works
The script defines a function double_numbers() that receives a list of integers and returns a new list with each number multiplied by 2.

The main() function initializes a sample list and prints the doubled result.
