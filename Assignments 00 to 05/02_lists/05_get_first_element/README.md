# 📋 List Element Viewer (Python CLI)

A simple yet interactive Python program that lets users **create a list** by entering elements one by one and then **displays the first element** from that list. It includes friendly prompts, clean formatting, and input validation for a better user experience.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Prompts the user to input elements into a list.
- Accepts multiple inputs until the user presses **Enter** on a blank line.
- Displays the full list created.
- Prints the **first element** from the list with a friendly message.
- Handles empty list scenarios gracefully.

## 🖥️ Example

```bash
🔹 Welcome to the List Element Viewer 🔹

📝 Let's build a list!
Type elements one by one. Press [Enter] on an empty line to finish.

Enter element #1: Apple
Enter element #2: Banana
Enter element #3: Cherry
Enter element #4:

📦 Your complete list: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']

✅ The first element in your list is: **Apple**
