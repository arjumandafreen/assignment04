🧽 How It Works
The canvas is divided into a grid of cells.

An eraser (pink circle) follows your mouse when you drag with the left button.

Any cell that overlaps with the eraser gets its color changed to white.

You can reset the grid using the Reset Canvas button.

💡 Customization
You can tweak these settings in the code:

CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT – Canvas size.

CELL_SIZE – Size of each cell.

ERASER_SIZE – Size of the eraser.

Colors, fonts, and shapes – personalize them as you like!
