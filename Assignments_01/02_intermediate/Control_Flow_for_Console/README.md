How to Play
Start the Game: When you run the game, you'll be welcomed with a brief introduction.

Game Rounds: The game will then run for 5 rounds. In each round:

A random number will be generated for both you and the computer (between 1 and 100).

You will be shown your number and asked if you think your number is higher or lower than the computer’s number.

Make Your Guess: After seeing your number, you will be prompted to input either higher or lower based on your guess:

If your guess is correct, you earn a point.

If your guess is incorrect, you get no points for that round.
